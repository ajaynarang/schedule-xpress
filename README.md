ScheduleXpress is a user-friendly app built in NextJS/ReactJS. It efficiently assign teachers and manage attendance at Hogwarts.

## Important notes for assignment: 
- Besides unit tests, I have included a single integration test using Jest, haven't used Cucumber at the moment however same test can be converted to cucumber.
- I've used the Next.js app router but didn't used server components instead used client components as this was small assignment.
- For data, I've used mock data.
- App is currently hosted on Vercel. Please use the below demo link
